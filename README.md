**[Live Demo on GitHub Pages](https://gelan007.github.io/user-management-table-assignment/)**

## Project Overview

This project is a test assignment aimed at evaluating skills in creating a React application using Redux Toolkit and TypeScript. The main focus is on building a **User Management Table** with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.

### Features

- **User Management Table**: Displays user information, including name, username, email, and phone, fetched from a mock API.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Allows dynamic filtering of users by name, username, email, and phone as the user types in the search inputs for each column.
- **Sorting**: Users can sort the table by different columns.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Used to manage the state of the application efficiently.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the entire application.

### Libraries Used

- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: For building the main table with a user-friendly and visually appealing design.
- **PrimeReact**: An alternative version of the table is implemented using PrimeReact and is available on a different branch.

## Project Structure

### Main Branch (`main`)

The primary version of the User Management Table is located on the `main` branch. This version utilizes **MUI** for the table design.

### PrimeReact Version (`primereact`)

A second version of the User Management Table, built using **PrimeReact**, is available on the `primereact` branch.
